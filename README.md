# Among Us Coding

Henloo!
So this is a tiny repo where I keep all my Among Us Coding related stuff.

## Required resources

- Python 3.7 or newer
- pyautogui (https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/)
- keyboard (https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/)

For bot I have used ctypes from windll, so read pixels from display, probably won't work on anything other than Windows.

## Encountered a bug?

- In Github there is a tab called Issues.
- There to the right is a button called "New issue"
- In the title put filename and the issue you were facing in one short sentence (feel free to add longer text, screens or anything to comments down there as well)
- To the right you can assign a Label as well, you can add a label called "Bug".

## A new feature or improvement maybe?

- Same as before but add the request instead of a bug.
- Add label "enhancement" instead.

# List of files

I'll try to keep this updated but I might be too lazy to update this every time.

### among_bot.py

This is going to be an autonomous crewmate in Skeld. Whether I finish it or not is, again, up to my lazyness and level of skill I have.

### auto_rejoin.py

I got pissed off trying to reconnect to the lobby I was in when I got disconnected. So I created this mini-file to do the manual "press cross, write code, try" itself.

### auto_text.py

This will have sentences to write.
In each list there will be a pool of sentences of same type. The code will then pick random one from there and eventually write them all out.

### auto_text_with_rule_numbers.py

Same as previous but it will count the number of rules made and then enumerate them.

### long_auto_text_with_comments.py

First-second-third version of auto_text filled with comments to help Lemongrass understand what is going on there.\
(She has little to no experience with coding)
